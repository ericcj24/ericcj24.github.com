The process of pushing green energy is slow. Solar power, wind power, bio energy development are slow, and there are even some pushing-back on the implementation of wind farms. Some local residents fought against the implementation of wind farm off their coast because they worry about that they may lose their scenery to the ocean. I am a frequent commuter between Chicago and Champaign by train, and I find it anecdote to see those lovely white wind turbines standings on the horizon of the green farm ground. 
This brought me to think about how to push public's acceptance to wind farm. People are slow to accept changes, and new technologies. I think about using popular culture as a break through point to re-introduce wind farm to people.
Associations like a cruise trip to Titanic, empire state building to An affair to Remember and Sleepless Seattle, and Casablanca to, well, the movie Casablanca, the unforgettable movies were so successful that it creates a iconic association between the location where the movie was filmed and the story of the movie. Without personally experiencing it, people gradually accept the idea of a new life style, a new product, and eventually, a new technology. I propose that investment should be put together to write, and shot a good movie that associates wind farm with, maybe, say, a everlasting love story. Maybe there could even be a scene taken right in fhe vast farm ground, the  green farm ground filled the picture, our beautiful heroin stands right in front the white blades of wind turbine, and re-united her destined mate who just came back from a serious war fair. The background music is tear-drawing, and in the background of the picture, the entire wind farm is standing there. The moving story and beautiful scene would take influence in popular culture, with wind turbine in it, people would start to accept wind farm as a friendly, and even welcoming image.
With this publicity, the next step is to raise more money from the public, with the money, there comes a chance to influence the D.C.. With persuasive lobbyists in D.C. influence Washington's law-making in Gay-rights, Affirmative action, Petroleum and Environment fight, the green energy, especially the wind farm technology should equip themselves with a stronger and more influential lobby group. The later could put more persuasion on congressional decision. And by that time, we shall see a Renaissance of the green energy.
