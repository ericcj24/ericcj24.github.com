When it comes to travel with your family in the park on a sunny Sunday, people always come to appreciate that shaded area under the tree, or beside the building. 

Art Duo "Christo and Jeanne-Claude":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christo_and_Jeanne-Claude who are famous for their international series of large-sale outdoor installations. They used to took years to gain their permission to put their installations in central park.I admire their artistic spirit and appreciate their wonderful effort to bring inspirations to urban life.

They first proposed the project in 1979, but it was not approved until 2005.

Technology should also create a better living environment and inspire creativity.
