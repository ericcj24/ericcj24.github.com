This image processing app features "histogram":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram and RGB coloring. 

The application's main frame is developed on Android Eclipse platform (Android SDK), I also used a NDK package to embed C code in JAVA to do the image processing part.

This project is part of the Embedded DSP class, the code could be found "here":https://github.com/ericcj24/Image-Processing-Android-App .
