h3. Overview

As promised I am going to talk about getting the authorization from OAuth2. OAuth2 is a popular authorization protocol used by website like twitter, and other social websites in their APIs. Basic OAuth2 authorization involves two stages: first obtain authorization code, second obtain access_token.

h3. Python Demo

Taking social website Douban as an example
{% highlight python %}
import urllib
import requests
SCOPE = 'douban_basic_common,shuo_basic_r,shuo_basic_w' # getting more access by adding more parameters
APP_KEY = YOUR_APP_KEY # sometimes called API_KEY, obtain upon registration for API
APP_SECRET = YOUR_APP_SECRET # sometimes called API_SECRET, obtain upon registration for API
REDIRECT_URI = YOUR_CALLBACK_URI # this http address would be the address to receive authorization code, and access_token returned from website
DOUBAN_RESPONSE_TYPE = 'code'
DOUBAN_AUTHORIZATION_URI = "https://www.douban.com/service/auth2/"
DOUBAN_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI = "https://www.douban.com/service/auth2/"
v = {'client_id':APP_KEY, 'redirect_uri':REDIRECT_URI,'response_type':'code','scope':SCOPE}
params = urllib.urlencode(v)
url = DOUBAN_AUTHORIZATION_URI+params
# now, go to your browser, go to your generated url, click on accept authorization, then you would be redirect to REDIRECT_URI+code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE, the YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE would be appended at the end of that address
code = YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE
# up to this point, you finished first step, obtain authorization code
v2 = {'client_id':APP_KEY, 'client_secret':APP_SECRET','redirect_uri':REDIRECT_URI, 'grant_type':'authorization_code','code':code}
url2 = DOUBAN_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI
r = requests.post(url2,data = v2)
r.status_code # should be 200 if everything is right
r_json = r.json()
# now you could see response in json format, with access_token in it
{% endhighlight %}

Just remember that first stage uses HTTP method GET, second stage uses HTTP method POST (that means you have to pass your encoded v2 to data, instead of params!!!)

Now you should have your access_token, go nuts!
