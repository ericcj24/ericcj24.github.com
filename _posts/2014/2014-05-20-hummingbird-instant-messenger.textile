Inspired by a tech talk given by the Facebook messenger developer team, I am developing my own instant messenger app on Android, named hummingbird, it's going to be a light weight messenger app that uses mqtt protocol.

Still at early stage of setting up the UI, working with the famous open source "slidingmenu":https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu library by Mr Jeremy Feistein. suggestions are welcome!

Cheers!
