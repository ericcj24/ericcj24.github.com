I am making a simple Android app to graphically display Bitstamp's trading data through their "API":https://www.bitstamp.net/api/.

The app utilizes a open source Android charting library called "Androidplot":http://androidplot.com/, and a slide menu from "here":https://github.com/dmitry-zaitsev/AndroidSideMenu/.

"Check it out":https://github.com/ericcj24/simple-bitstamp-api-androidclient

I will try to add more functionality in project in the following days :)


Cheers
