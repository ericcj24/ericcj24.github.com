I am making a simple GUI java app to graphically display Bitstamp's trading data through their "API":https://www.bitstamp.net/api/.

The java app utilizes apache's "httpclient library":http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/ to make http connection, uses "Jackson":http://jackson.codehaus.org/ to bind JSON data to Java class and/or generic containers. 

<strike>The app also uses "jmathplot libary":https://code.google.com/p/jmathplot/ to help plot the data.</strike>
After careful considration, I switched my ploting tool to "JFreeChart":http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/ for its detailed documentation.

<strike>Find it at my project "repo":https://github.com/ericcj24/bitstamp.api.monitor </strike>
I have also changed the new project to a newer "repo":https://github.com/ericcj24/bitstamp.api.monitor1


I will try to add more functionality in project in the following days :)


Cheers
