I am making a simple GUI java app to graphically display Bitstamp's trading data through their "API":https://www.bitstamp.net/api/.

The java app utilizes apache's "httpclient library":http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/ to make http connection, uses "Jackson":http://jackson.codehaus.org/, to bind JSON data to Java class and/or generic containers. 

The app also uses "jmathplot libary":https://code.google.com/p/jmathplot/ to help plot the data.

I will try to add more functionality in project in the following days :)

Cheers
