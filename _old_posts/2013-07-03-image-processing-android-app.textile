This image processing app features "histogram":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram and RGB coloring. 

The application's main frame is developed on Android Eclipse platform (Android SDK), I also used a NDK package to embed C++ code in JAVA to do the image processing part.The program has a "OpenCV":http://opencv.org/ dependency, as the program calls some computer vision class from the OpenCV library.The successful install and run the program on Android device, a "OpenCV Manager":https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opencv.engine&hl=en from Google Play is also needed.

This screenshot (pic 2) shows the app with the histogram option chosen, as left half of the image has a clearer detail of the object in the far distance

This project is part of the Embedded Digital Signal Processing (DSP) class, the code could be found "here":https://github.com/ericcj24/Image-Processing-Android-App .
