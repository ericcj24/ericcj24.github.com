h3. Overview

This application is an extension to the original spectrogram application. When people are singing to the microphone, the application calculating the autocorrelation of the sound recorded, it finds the pitch in his voice and compare it to the reference. The reference would be a recording of the piano play of the same song (piano would generate accurate pitch, thus this file, which recored and processed with MATLAB, could be serve as reference). Every matching between human voice and the reference pitch would gain one point, at the end of the song, a total score would be displayed.
Some key concept may be useful during the signal processing part are: "autocorrelation":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation , "voice detection":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_activity_detection

h3. MATLAB simulation

MATLAB main function call

{% highlight matlab %}
numdatablc = size(a4)/256; % number of data blocks, each block has 256 points, store in variable a4
pdata1 = zeros(1,numdatablc); % initialize return array
for i=0:numdatablc-1
    temp = a4(i*256+1:(i+1)*256);
    if voidet(temp) % do voice detection
        pdata1(i+1) = proc(temp,f); % do autocorrelation
    else
        pdata1(i+1) = 0;
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}


MATLAB function for autocorrelation and pitch finding

{% highlight matlab %}
function [ y ] = proc( x,f )
% f: sampling frequency
% filter
% f_pi/pi = f/4Khz
% f_pi = 2pi/range
% range = 8KHz/f = indx_max - indx_sec_max
% human vocal range: 75 ~ 500 Hz
% range: 8000/500 ~ 8000/75 => floor 16 ~ 107
lowr = floor(f/500); 
upr = ceil(f/75);
x_cor = xcorr(x);
x_filt = x_cor;
[xmax, po] = max(x_filt);
x_filt(1:lowr+po) = 0;
x_filt(po+upr+1:end) = 0;
[xmax1,pmax] = max(x_filt);
y = f/(pmax-po);
end
{% endhighlight %}


MATLAB function for voice detection

{% highlight matlab %}
function [ y ] = voidet(x)
x2 = x.^2;
xs = sum(x2);
if xs > 50000000 %2.56
    y = 1;
else
    y = 0;
end
end
{% endhighlight %}

During the song playing, lyrics would scrolling though the screen, real-time calculated pitch and score displayed on the screen, and real-time spectrogram would be scrolling through the right part of the screen with the pitch (the fundamental frequency of a human voice, usually the lowest frequency among all the harmonics) mapped out on the screen in red.

This is really a funny project that combines signal processing theory with practical gaming experience.

This is the free choice of the final project of the Embedded Digital Signal Processing (DSP) lab, the source code of the project could be found "here":https://github.com/ericcj24/Karaoke-Game-Android-App
